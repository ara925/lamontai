# API Connection Status Monitoring Implementation

This document explains the API connection status monitoring system implemented in the Lamont.ai application.

## Overview

The implementation provides real-time monitoring of both API and database connection status on the dashboard UI. This helps users quickly identify connectivity issues between the frontend application and backend services.

## Components Modified

1. **Backend Health Endpoint** (`lamontai/backend/src/index.ts`)
   - Enhanced to include database connection status
   - Returns detailed health information including environment and version
   - Tests database connectivity on each health check request

2. **API Client** (`lamontai/src/lib/api-client.ts`)
   - Added database status tracking to the connection status object
   - Enhanced connection status checker to interpret database status from health endpoint
   - Improved error handling and status reporting

3. **Dashboard UI** (`lamontai/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
   - Added database connection status indicator
   - Updated state management to include database status
   - Enhanced UI to display both API and database connection status with color coding

## How It Works

1. The frontend regularly polls the backend health endpoint
2. The backend health endpoint checks database connectivity in real-time
3. The frontend updates its connection status display based on the responses
4. Users see color-coded indicators for both API server and database connectivity

## Status Codes

- **API Status**:
  - `connected` (Green): API server is reachable
  - `disconnected` (Red): API server is not reachable
  - `checking` (Yellow): Currently checking connection status
  - `unknown` (Gray): Status has not been checked yet
  - `rate_limited` (Orange): Too many requests sent to the API
  - `error` (Red): Error occurred during connection check

- **Database Status**:
  - `connected` (Green): Database connection successful
  - `disconnected` (Red): Database connection failed
  - `unknown` (Gray): Status not checked yet

## Testing

A test script is included (`test-health.js`) that can be used to verify the health endpoint functionality:

```bash
node test-health.js
```

This script tests both the health endpoint and a protected endpoint to verify authentication is working correctly.

## Future Improvements

1. Add WebSocket support for real-time status updates
2. Implement more detailed monitoring of database metrics
3. Add historical uptime data
4. Create an admin dashboard with more detailed system health information
