# Comprehensive Issue Resolution Plan

## Dynamic Server Usage Warnings

### Root Cause
Routes that use server-side features (cookies, headers, request properties) can't be statically generated.

### Solution Approach
1. Properly mark all API routes with the correct configuration:
   - Use `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` for all routes that need request data
   - Add explicit `export const runtime = 'edge'` or `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` depending on compatibility
   - Add strict null/undefined checking to all routes

2. Check all API routes that access:
   - `request.cookies`
   - `request.headers`
   - `nextUrl.searchParams`

### Specific Fixes Needed
- Update Google Search Console OAuth callback route to handle searchParams correctly
- Ensure all getUserIdFromRequest calls are in routes marked as dynamic
- Add proper error handling for all dynamic server access

## PrismaNeon Availability Warnings

### Root Cause
The application is trying to use PrismaNeon but it's not available in the current environment.

### Solution Approach
1. Create proper detection and fallback logic in prisma-cloudflare.ts
2. Update error handling to be less verbose in non-error conditions
3. Handle environment-specific connection properly

### Specific Fixes Needed
- Update PrismaNeon initialization with better error handling
- Add check before logging "not available" message 
- Ensure proper fallback works without warnings

## Edge Runtime Compatibility Issues

### Root Cause
Some Node.js APIs are being used in Edge runtime contexts.

### Solution Approach
1. Create proper runtime detection in all routes
2. Ensure Node.js-specific code is only loaded in Node.js runtime
3. Create edge-compatible alternatives for all Node.js functionality

### Specific Fixes Needed
- Audit all API routes to ensure they correctly specify runtime
- Add dynamic imports for Node.js specific packages
- Create edge-compatible alternatives for all critical functionality

## Authentication Flow Issues

### Root Cause
The application has a split authentication system with both NextAuth and custom JWT implementation.

### Solution Approach
1. Create clear boundaries between auth systems
2. Ensure consistent patterns are used throughout the application
3. Standardize error handling and response formats

### Specific Fixes Needed
- Fix edge authentication routes to handle all edge cases
- Update route-specific error handling with proper type guards
- Standardize auth response format across all endpoints

## Implementation Priority Order

1. Server-Side Utilities
   - Update server-auth-utils.ts with proper error handling
   - Make core utility functions runtime-agnostic

2. Database Connection Layer
   - Fix prisma-cloudflare.ts to handle Neon availability gracefully
   - Ensure connection pooling works correctly in all environments

3. Authentication System
   - Fix all authentication routes to properly handle cookies and headers
   - Update edge-compatible auth handlers

4. API Routes
   - Update all API routes with proper runtime and dynamic settings
   - Fix cookie and header handling in all routes
   - Add comprehensive error handling

5. Build Configuration
   - Update next.config.js to handle environment-specific builds
   - Configure proper error reporting during builds

## Quality Assurance Plan

For each component fixed:
1. Run targeted tests before and after changes
2. Verify each route works in both Node.js and Edge runtime
3. Check for any new errors introduced by changes
4. Ensure configuration is consistent across all similar routes
