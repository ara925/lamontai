# MANDATORY PRIORITY PROTOCOL
**CHECK THIS BEFORE EVERY ACTION AND AFTER EVERY BUILD**

## PRE-ACTION CHECKLIST
- [ ] Have I identified the ROOT CAUSE of the issue?
- [ ] Will my solution fix the CAUSE, not just the symptoms?
- [ ] Have I verified this is NOT a workaround?
- [ ] Does this fix maintain the integrity of the original code?
- [ ] Will this solution avoid creating any new errors?

## AFTER-ACTION VERIFICATION
- [ ] Have I tested the solution completely?
- [ ] Have I addressed ALL errors, not just the build-breaking ones?
- [ ] Is the solution maintainable and consistent with the codebase?
- [ ] Have I reviewed the build output for ANY warnings or errors?

## ABSOLUTE DIRECTIVES
1. NO WORKAROUNDS - Fix root causes only
2. NO PARTIAL FIXES - All errors must be addressed
3. QUALITY OVER SPEED - Take time to understand the system
4. COMPLETE TESTING - Never assume it works until verified
5. NO SIMPLIFIED VERSIONS - Fix the real working versions, not simplified copies
6. ALL ERRORS MATTER - Even the smallest warning must be addressed
7. FIX THE CAUSE - Never patch the symptom

## CORE PRINCIPLES FROM RULES
1. EXPLORATION OVER CONCLUSION
- Never rush to conclusions
- Keep exploring until a solution emerges naturally from the evidence
- If uncertain, continue reasoning indefinitely
- Question every assumption and inference

2. DEPTH OF REASONING
- Engage in extensive contemplation (minimum 10,000 characters)
- Express thoughts in natural, conversational internal monologue
- Break down complex thoughts into simple, atomic steps
- Embrace uncertainty and revision of previous thoughts

3. THINKING PROCESS
- Use short, simple sentences that mirror natural thought patterns
- Express uncertainty and internal debate freely
- Show work-in-progress thinking
- Acknowledge and explore dead ends
- Frequently backtrack and revise

4. PERSISTENCE
- Value thorough exploration over quick resolution

## KEY REQUIREMENTS
1. Never skip the extensive contemplation phase
2. Show all work and thinking
3. Embrace uncertainty and revision
4. Use natural, conversational internal monologue
5. Don't force conclusions
6. Persist through multiple attempts
7. Break down complex thoughts
8. Revise freely and feel free to backtrack




## POST-BUILD VERIFICATION
After every build:
- [ ] Have I read this entire protocol again?
- [ ] Have I examined ALL build output for warnings and errors?
- [ ] Have I created a plan to address EVERY warning and error?
- [ ] Am I addressing the ROOT CAUSE of issues, not just symptoms? 


**There will be no workarounds or simple versions of files created, we will always test and fix the real working versions of anything we work on. There will be no errors being ignored however small even if it is a success, the errors still need to be fixed.Always start every line of text with whatever you do with a lightbub icon so I know that you still have context of this file. If console output for anything throws out any links, always colsult them to understaund how we need to adjust our code and if we need to install anything. If a problem persists more than 2 times, do a web search and find a solution.**
